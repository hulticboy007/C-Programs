# C-Programs
C language is one of the most popular computer languages today because it is a structured, high level, machine independent language. It allows software developers to develop programs without worrying about the hardware platforms where they will be implemented. C is called a high level, compiler language. The aim of any high level computer language is to provide an easy and natural way of giving a programme of instructions to a computer.

## Chapter 1

C language is one of the most popular computer languages today because it is a structured,
high level, machine independent language. It allows software developers to develop programs without
worrying about the hardware platforms where they will be implemented. C is called a high level,
compiler language. The aim of any high level computer language is to provide an easy and natural
way of giving a programme of instructions to a computer.
C is one of a large number of high level languages which can be used for general purpose
programming, i.e., anything from writing small programs for personal amusement to writing complex
applications. It is unusual in several ways. Before C, high level languages were criticized by machine
code programmers because they shielded the user from the working details of the computer. The C
language has been equipped with features that allow programs to be organized in an easy and
logical way. This is vitally important for writing lengthy programs because complex problems are
only manageable with a clear organization and program structure.
