# C-Programs
C language is one of the most popular computer languages today because it is a structured, high level, machine independent language. It allows software developers to develop programs without worrying about the hardware platforms where they will be implemented. C is called a high level, compiler language. The aim of any high level computer language is to provide an easy and natural way of giving a programme of instructions to a computer.

## Chapter 1

C language is one of the most popular computer languages today because it is a structured,
high level, machine independent language. It allows software developers to develop programs without
worrying about the hardware platforms where they will be implemented. C is called a high level,
compiler language. The aim of any high level computer language is to provide an easy and natural
way of giving a programme of instructions to a computer.
C is one of a large number of high level languages which can be used for general purpose
programming, i.e., anything from writing small programs for personal amusement to writing complex
applications. It is unusual in several ways. Before C, high level languages were criticized by machine
code programmers because they shielded the user from the working details of the computer. The C
language has been equipped with features that allow programs to be organized in an easy and
logical way. This is vitally important for writing lengthy programs because complex problems are
only manageable with a clear organization and program structure.
C allows meaningful variable names and meaningful function names to be used in programs
without any loss of efficiency and it gives a complete freedom of style, it has a set of very flexible
loop constructions and neat ways of making decisions. These provide an excellent basis for controlling
the flow of programs. Another feature of C is the way it can express ideas concisely. The richness of
a language shapes what it can talk about. C gives us the apparatus to build neat and compact programs.
C tries to make the best of a computer by linking as closely as possible to the local environment.
The increasing popularity of C is probably due to its many desirable qualities. It is a robust
language whose rich set of built-in functions and operators can be used to write any complex program.
The C compiler combines the capabilities of an assembly language with the features of a high-level
language and therefore it is well suited for writing both system software and business packages.
Programs written in C are efficient and fast. This is due to its variety of data types and powerful
operators. C is highly portable. This means that C programs written for one computer can be run on
another with little or no modification. Another feature of C is its ability to extend itself.
